# The task

The task was to create a CLI application that would return a random color when run.

### What it does

It does return a hash block in a random color with the hex code of that color when is run in command line. If user specifies a color (e.g. "red"), the block will be colored that and return the hex code of the color chosen. If luminosity is added to that (e.g. "red dark"), the block is returned in this color.
